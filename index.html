          * Persona: Meera, 38, is part of a women-led self-help group in a rural area.<br> 
            The group applies for government and NGO funds, but approvals are slow and often biased.<br>
            Members do not know where their applications are stuck.<br>
          * Constraint: Limited internet access and low digital literacy.<br>
          * Round 1 Task: Identify: Where trust breaks in the current system, Who controls decisions,<br>

            without exposing private data, and What “fair selection” should look like.<br>
